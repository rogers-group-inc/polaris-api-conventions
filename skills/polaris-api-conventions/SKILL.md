description: "Client guide for the Polaris IP-management and monitoring REST API (/api/v1): bearer tokens bound to roles, error envelope and status conventions, filter-don't-403 dashboard/NOC feeds, search scopes, IPAM blocks/networks/reservations, the SIEM quarantine flow, and the events audit tail, with curl examples. Load when a project calls a Polaris server, needs a POLARIS_TOKEN, quarantines a device from a SIEM/EDR, builds a NOC wallboard or inventory sync, or asks what a Polaris endpoint returns."

# Polaris API — client conventions

Polaris is an IP-address-management and device-monitoring application (subnets, reservations,
asset inventory, FortiGate-driven discovery, alerting). It exposes a JSON REST API for
external systems: SIEM-driven quarantine, NOC kiosks and wallboards, inventory consumers and
automation scripts. Everything lives under `<polaris-url>/api/v1`; requests and responses are
JSON. **Build against what the developer page documents** (these references are generated
from it) — Polaris has many more endpoints backing its own UI, and those may change without
notice.

## Getting in

1. An administrator mints a token under **Server Settings → API Tokens**; the raw value
   (`polaris_<32-character tail>`) is shown once. Keep it in a secret store; send it as
   `Authorization: Bearer $POLARIS_TOKEN` on every request.
2. Every token is **bound to a Role** and can do exactly what that role's permission matrix
   allows (`none / read / write / fullwrite` per function key). Ask for a purpose-built,
   least-privilege role (e.g. assets read-only, or quarantine write scoped to named
   integrations) rather than an admin-equivalent one.
3. Smoke-test with a cheap read the role allows (`GET /assets?limit=1` → 200). There is no
   introspection endpoint; `GET /auth/me` answers `{"authenticated": false}` for bearer callers.
4. Writes made with a token appear in the Polaris audit log as `api:<token name>`.

## The six contract rules

1. **401 is undifferentiated.** Missing, revoked, expired and malformed tokens all get the same
   401; do not try to tell them apart.
2. **404, not 403, for anything outside your visibility scope** (an alert, a saved dashboard,
   a network scan you may not see). A 403 means the role lacks the permission outright.
3. **Filter-don't-403 feeds.** `/dashboard/noc-summary`, `/dashboard/summary`,
   `/dashboard/filter-options` and `/search` return the sections the role can read and leave
   the rest empty with the response shape unchanged — a read-only kiosk renders whatever it is
   entitled to. Poll them at wallboard cadence (10–30 s); they are cached server-side ~10 s.
4. **Ownership-scoped keys need `fullwrite` for tokens.** Networks, reservations and contacts
   carry an ownership dimension where `write` edits only rows the *session user* created. A
   token has no username, so a `write`-level token can CREATE those rows but gets 403 on every
   edit/delete. Bind IPAM-managing tokens to a role with `fullwrite` on `subnets` /
   `reservations`.
5. **Page with `total`, not `.length`.** Lists return `{ <items>, total, limit, offset }`
   (`total` is the full filtered count); `limit`/`offset` only — there is no `page` parameter
   except on the per-subnet IP map.
6. **Deprecated aliases carry headers.** `/notifications` → `/alerts`,
   `/notification-rules` → `/automations`, `/notification-channels` → `/delivery-channels`
   still answer, with `Deprecation: true` and a `Link: <successor>; rel="successor-version"`
   header. Use the new paths.

Errors are always `{ "error": "<message>" }` with 400 (validation, names the field), 401,
403, 404, 409 (conflicts with current state: overlapping subnet, duplicate reservation,
block with active reservations), 429 (back off — machine-facing limiters are generous, so a
429 usually means a runaway loop), 5xx.

## The SIEM quarantine flow (short form)

```
GET  /assets/quarantine-availability          # pushEnabled must be true or every push fails
GET  /assets?search=<mac|ip|hostname>&limit=5 # find the asset id (one param matches all three)
POST /assets/:id/quarantine  {"reason": "..."} # per-FortiGate targets[] in the response
POST /assets/:id/quarantine/verify            # later: { targets, driftDetected } (rate-limited)
DELETE /assets/:id/quarantine                 # release; restores prior status + monitoring
```
Refusals: 400 for infrastructure types or no known MAC, 409 with no recent sightings, 502
when zero gates accepted (status is not flipped). Bulk: `POST /assets/bulk-quarantine`
(`ids[]` ≤500, one result per id, one bad asset never fails the batch).

## Keeping this plugin current

The references are generated from the Polaris checkout's `public/api.html`; when Polaris
changes its API page, re-run `scripts/import-api-html.mjs` (see the repo README) and bump the
plugin version. `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` records the source page's sha256.
